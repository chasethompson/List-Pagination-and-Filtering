# Techdegree-Project-2
This is the second Treehouse Techdegree Project

The goal of this project seems to really mimic that of an actual job.

You're given a set of parameters to work within, and current code that might've
come from a previous dev, project, etc.

Using the current set up, you're asked to add functionality and improve the UI dynamically.
